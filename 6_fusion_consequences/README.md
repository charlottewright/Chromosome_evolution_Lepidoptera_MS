# Section 6: Consequences of fusions

[**fusion_age**](<>)

Code and data needed to generate the scatterplots of repeat density compared to proportional length for each chromosome/portion of a fused chromosome in a species with a recent fusion and a species with an old fusion.
The TSV files contain repeat density and proportional chromosome length (Fig5d_recent_fusion_repeat_density_141232.tsv and Fig5e_old_fusion_repeat_density_141232.tsv).
The TSV files were plotted using an R script (Fig5D-Fig5H.R).

[**repeat_density_all_fusions**](<>)

Code and data needed to generate the boxplots of the difference between the expected and observed repeat density in portions of fused chromosomes. 
The TSV file plotted (observed_vs_expected_repeat_density_per_segment_141232.tsv) was generated from two TSV files (Fusion_segment_merian_info_adjusted.tsv and combined_repeat_counts_per_chr_and_Merian.tsv) and plotted using an R script (Fig5D-Fig5H.R).

[**repeats_in_rearranged_species**](<>)

Code and data needed to generate the scatterplots of repeat density compared to proportional length for species of Lysandra and Pierini, which contain highly rearranged chromosomes relative to Merian elements.
The TSV files contain repeat density and proportional chromosome length (Repeat_density_vs_prop_length_Lysandra_141232.tsv, Repeat_density_vs_prop_length_Pierini_141232.tsv) and are plotted using an R script (Fig5D-Fig5H.R).

[**recent_fusions**](<>)

Code and data needed to generate the scatterplots of repeat density in 100 kb windows across a chromosome that has undergone fusion in one species and the orthologous chromosomes in a sister species which has not undergone fusion in Extended Data Figure 7.
The TSV files contain repeat density in 100 kb windows (repeat_density_across_fusion_chr_in_Agonopterix_subpropinquella_151223.tsv, repeat_density_across_fusion_chr_in_Agrochola_circellaris_151223.tsv, repeat_density_across_fusion_chr_in_Dendrolimus_kikuchii_151223.tsv).
These TSV files were plotted using an R script (Repeat_density_along_fused_vs_unfused_chr_supfig.R).

[**old_fusion**](<>)

Code and data needed to generate the scatterplot of repeat density in 100 kb windows across the chromosome LR761656.1 in *Aphantopus hyperantus* which is the product of a fusion event. The TSV file (repeat_density_across_fusion_chr_in_Aphantopus_hyperantus_151223.tsv) contains repeat density in 100 kb windows along LR761656.1 and is plotted using an R script (Repeat_density_along_fused_vs_unfused_chr_supfig.R) to generate Extended Data Figure 8.
